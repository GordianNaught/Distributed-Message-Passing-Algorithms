# Distributed Message Passing Algorithms

This repository contains example golang implementations of algorithms from `Distributed Algorithms for Message Passing Systems` by Michel Raynal.
There is no gaurantee of quality, completeness, or correctness.
I'm writing these for my own edification and putting them out there in case someone finds them useful or interesting.
